      I have a personal matter to discuss with you. Our food supplies are running
      low. To make matters worse, someone has tainted our food with garlic. Would
      you support us? I simply ask for 7 PEPPERS. As far as I know, they usually

      to the Count? Unfortunately, I must disappoint you. Our lord has temporarily
      gone to visit Lord Container to watch the Footed-Ball matches while enjoying
      fine spirits. You'll have to head towards the Peppert.

    m_Localized: Mediator! I've heard that you're heading our way. However, I must
      admit that I'm quite skeptical of strangers and hesitant to let someone in
      who hasn't proven their friendship towards our kingdom. Bring me 6 LETTUCES,
      a symbol of our economy. They are so common that you can find them in the vicinity
      of any village. Show us this way that you're worthy of our trust. Then I'll
      allow you to pass.

      the vampires. Hurry up, Count Gahlammon won''t wait forever to issue the order
      for an attack, so you must deliver this letter to him as soon as possible.
      Take this armor as a token of gratitude.'

      attire. Our kingdom doesn't have the best relationship with those horseradish
      vampires, and you may encounter trouble with the palace guards. [TAB - Inventory]
      Oh well... Horseradish is a precious spice, and even though I have my own lettuce
      fields, I miss the times when we could import horseradish... Listen, could
      you help me? Bring me 8 HORSERADISH, and I promise you won't regret it! As
      far as I know, you can find it in the vicinity of the mountains or vampire
      plantations.

      are tickets to a concert of a certain function band. Once she receives them,
      she'll forget about attacking the Peppuntry. Take them to the castle, but make
      sure General Lora doesn't find out they're from me.

      is in favor of war, so maybe with your help, we can reverse this. Take this
      letter and fly to the Radublic swiftly!

      note, when delivering it, that General Lora will provide a clarification as
      soon as she returns from the concert. Congratulations, Mediator. You have managed
